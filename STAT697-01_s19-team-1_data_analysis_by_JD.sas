Note: This compares the column "city" from sighting_09_02_2016 and 
sighting_09_03_2016 to the column "pokemonId" from the same datasets.

Limitations: There were no limitations identified due to the fact there were no 
missing values in the columns from the tables being referenced in this analysis.

Methodology: Use GROUP BY clause in proc sql to output the total number of 
pokemon by city, and then use ORDER BY to sort the Total_pokemon variable in 
descending order.Use PROC REPORT to output ten observations of selected columns.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data.

Limitations: There were no limitations identified due to the fact there were no 
missing values in the columns from the tables being referenced in this analysis.

Methodology: Use WHERE clause in proc sql to constrain the continent value to
"America", and then use ORDER BY to sort the value of attack in descending 
order.Use outobs= to limit the number of output.Use PROC GLM for modeling.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data.

Methodology: Use PROC SQL to create a table containing the average values of

Followup Steps: Try other methods of data visualization that allows us to see
the results and generate insights easier.
